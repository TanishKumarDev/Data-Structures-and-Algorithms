  * 3442. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I
  * https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-even-and-odd-frequency-i/description/
  * 
  * Problem:
  * Given a string s of lowercase English letters, find the maximum difference between
  * frequencies of two characters where one has odd frequency and one has even frequency.
  * 
  * Example 1:
  * Input: s = "aaaaabbc"
  * Output: 3
  * Explanation: 'a' has odd frequency 5, 'b' has even frequency 2. Difference is 5-2=3
  * 
  * Example 2:
  * Input: s = "abcabcab"
  * Output: 1
  * Explanation: 'a' has odd frequency 3, 'c' has even frequency 2. Difference is 3-2=1
  * 
  * Constraints:
  * - 3 <= s.length <= 100
  * - s consists only of lowercase English letters
  * - s contains at least one character with odd frequency and one with even frequency
  * 
  * Intuition:
  * - Count the frequency of each character in the string.
  * - Track the maximum frequency of characters with odd counts and the minimum frequency of characters with even counts.
  * - Return the difference between the maximum odd frequency and the minimum even frequency.
  * 
  *
  * Algorithm:
  * 1. Initialize a frequency array of size 26 to count occurrences of each character.
  * 2. Iterate through the string and populate the frequency array.
  * 3. Traverse the frequency array to find the maximum odd frequency and the minimum even frequency.
  * 4. If no valid odd or even frequency is found, return 0.
  * 5. Return the difference between the maximum odd frequency and the minimum even frequency.
  * 
  * Time Complexity:
  * O(n), where n is the length of the string s, since we traverse the string and the frequency array.
  * 
  * Space Complexity:
  * O(1), since the frequency array has a fixed size of 26 (for lowercase English letters).
