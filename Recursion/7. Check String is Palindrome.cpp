/**  
 * Problem: Check if a string reads the same forwards and backwards
 * 
 * A string is a palindrome if it remains unchanged when reversed.
 * 
 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/palindrome-string0817/1
 * 
 * - Examples:
 * - "madam" -> true (reads same forwards and backwards)
 * - "hello" -> false (reads different)
 * - "racecar" -> true
 * - "a" -> true (single character)
 * - "" -> true (empty string)
 * 
 * Approaches:
 * 1. Recursive Two-Pointer Approach
 * 2. Iterative Two-Pointer Approach
 * 3. Using String Reversal
 * 
 * Intuition:
 * - A string is palindrome if first and last characters match,
 *   and the substring between them is also a palindrome
 * - We can check this by comparing characters from both ends
 * - Process continues until we reach the middle
 * - Single character and empty string are always palindromes

/**
 * Additional Notes:
 * 1. Two-Pointer Technique:
 *    - Very efficient for palindrome checking
 *    - Works for both even and odd length strings
 *    - Can be extended to check substrings
 * 
 * 2. Recursive vs Iterative:
 *    - Iterative is more space efficient (O(1) vs O(n))
 *    - Both have same time complexity O(n)
 *    - Recursive is more elegant but can cause stack overflow for long strings
 * 
 * 3. Edge Cases:
 *    - Empty string: always palindrome
 *    - Single character: always palindrome
 *    - Even length: pointers meet at middle
 *    - Odd length: pointers cross at middle
 * 
 * 4. Variations:
 *    - Case-insensitive palindrome (convert to lowercase first)
 *    - Alphanumeric palindrome (ignore non-alphanumeric chars)
 *    - Word-level palindrome (check if words form palindrome)
 * 
 * 5. Applications:
 *    - DNA sequence analysis
 *    - Text processing
 *    - Natural language processing
 *    - Data validation
